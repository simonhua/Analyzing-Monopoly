# Analyzing Monopoly
An analysis of the movement of players within the game of Monopoly.  Our goal is to simulate a two-player game and keep track of how often each space is visited by the players/pieces.

All code was written in R in a R Markdown file.  The HTML file is also uploaded for easy viewing.  Details of the simulation are included in the files.  Toward the end of the file is a sorted table comprising of each square on the Monopoly board and how many times each was visited.  I included a conclusion in the end as well.  I hope you find this interesting :)
